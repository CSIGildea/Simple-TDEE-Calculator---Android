Made and published this application within six hours to get started into Android Development.

Simple TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) Calculator allows you to calculate your BMI,BMR and TDEE.

This app uses the standard Mifflin - St. Jeor Formula or Katch Formula (to compute with bodyfat) to calculate BMR. The Katch formula is much more accurate but requires your bodyfat percentage. Please provide your bodyfat percentage to receive the most accurate calculation.
